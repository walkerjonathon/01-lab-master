  <h2> Workshops</h2>
  <p>Location: see your personal timetable </p>
  <p>One 2-hour workshop per week (see timetable above).</p>
  <p>Practical workshops involve semi-taught lab exercises and hands-on coding, and are a focussed place to work on your assignments and develop practical skills. Attending all workshops will ensure that you keep up with the learning outcomes and work towards your individual project assignment (see below for details). Students who attend regularly tend to produce higher-quality work and gain better marks.</p>
  <h2> Your attendance at workshops counts towards the ongoing viva (10% of the final module mark). A module-wide weekly evaluation will help track and personalise the learning experience. </h2>
 <p> Work submitted without sufficient attendance may not meet the required standard, so could be rejected, and code is <strong>always</strong> examined for plagiarism
  
  
  <h2> Lectures </h2>
  <p><strong>Location:</strong> Bede Island 0.05</p>
  <p><strong>Time:</strong> Thuesdays 16:00-18:00</p>
  <p>Ten 2-hour lectures, every week (see timetable above).</p>
  <p>Lectures complement the practical workshops and cover essential technical issues as well as the wider perspectives on front-end web technologies. They also contain carefully-selected links for deeper information. You will learn to make intelligent choices and predict future industry trends in this rapidly changing field</p>
  
  
  <h2>Module Details</h2>
  <h3>Learning outcomes</h3>
  <p>By the end of this module, through attendance and participation in workshops, and after successful completion of lab tasks and assignments, students will be able to: </p>
  <ol>
        <li>Contextualise and critique the aims and culture driving current web technologies, how these have evolved and what part they play in modern web development.</li>
        <li>Develop a critical understanding of basic design principles, Information Architecture (IA), usability principles and semantic markup, and how these determine navigability, usability and website/webapp structure.</li>
		<li>Demonstrate evidence of a detailed understanding of the current front-end web technologies (HTML, CSS, Javascript), and make intelligent choices regarding their use and context.</li>
		<li>Create a fully standards-compliant, responsive and accessible website using HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript.</li>
      </ol>
  
  <p>In addition, best practice in general software development (e.g. version control, consistent code indentation, etc.) will be encouraged throughout the module. These will also be part of the marking criteria for the final project.</p>
  
  
  <h3>Blackboard resources</h3>
  <p>Blackboard is a crucial part of this module, so take some time to read through the material thereâ€”it contains:</p>
  <ul>

  <li>Announcements (including jobs)</li>
  <li>Module handbook + calendar</li>
  <li>Assignments + detailed marking scheme</li>
  <li>Labs (numbered, links to exercise code on GitHub)</li>
  <li>Lectures (numbered, links to slides in HTML + PDF)</li>
  <li>Resources</li>
  </ul>
  <p> The Resources section contains: </p>
    <ul>
  <li>GIT and GitHub guide<li>
  <li>articles, online tutorials, recommended books</li>

  </ul>
  
  
  <h3>Handing in work and submitting to Turnitin </h3>
 <p><strong>Feedback:</strong> will be given on work in progress during workshop sessions and in written form for assignments. The final assignment will be assessed within 20 days of the deadline.</p>
  <p><strong>Reminder:</strong> all marks are provisional, subject to moderation, and will be ratified by the June Progress and Awards Board.</p>
  <p><strong>Turnitin:</strong> the DMU Library has an excellent reference: [Frequently Asked Questions: Using TurnitinUK in Blackboard to submit your work] <a href="http://www.library.dmu.ac.uk/Support/Justask/index.php?page=175&faqcategory=14">http://www.library.dmu.ac.uk/Support/Justask/index.php?page=175&faqcategory=14</a></p>
