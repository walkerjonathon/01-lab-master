# Basic HTML5 Exercise

To help recap/update your previous (X)HTML knowledge and get you started with HTML5, convert the module handbook Markdown file into HTML5.

- **Focus on HTML5 markup only**: ignore how plain it looks (CSS styling will come later).
- **Preserve the semantic structure**: e.g. one # sign is a level 1 heading (h1), two ## is a level two heading (h2).
- Use your text editor's **search & replace** function thoughtfully.
- Place the img tag and all other markup **inside the body tag** - NOT inside the head section.
- The HTML `center` tag is deprecated in HTML5 (and only used here as Markdown hack) so **remove it**.
- The link to the 'html-css-js' image in the Markdown simply needs to be **local to the HTML file** (see the `img` tag in the template).
- **If it's taking too long**, trim off the bottom half of the table and delete some of the text paragraphs to shorten the process.
- If you find this too easy, **use some semantic HTML5 elements** (e.g. header, aside, section, etc.) for some of the content.
