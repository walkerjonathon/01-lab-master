### Assessment 0: (ongoing) active engagement
10% of overall marks

Your contribution and development from active participation in workshops and lectures will be assessed throughout the duration of the module. You simply need to attend, engage with the learning materials and show good progress in your understanding, skills and main project.

### Assessment 1: critical essay
25% of overall marks  
Deadline: 12pm Wednesday 1/11/2017 (week 5) (TBC) 
Submitted: on Turnitin

#### Deliverable:
A 2000-word written essay, surveying and analysing 3 websites—they can all be different, or cover a theme or particular topic. For instance, a comparison of one kind of site (e.g. portfolios, sports, gaming, media, commerce…); or sites that show how a technology is used across each (e.g. Javascript, HTML5 Canvas, CSS3 animations…).

#### What to look out for
- are there any technical issues or faults in the code (e.g. invalid HTML, Javascript errors in the console)?
- how is the website content (pages, video, sound, gallery, forum, blog, chat, etc) delivered technically?
- does the site appear to use data from any external APIs - if so, how?
- can you find evidence of any frameworks, libraries, or other ready-made components (look for filenames in names JavaScript '.js' and style '.css' imports in the source code)?
- is the site responsive? If so, where are the breakpoints and how are they used?
- is the navigation effective or is some content hard to find? can you identify any usability issues or errors?
- is the source code readable and well-structured?
- is it a single-page app (SPA) or a series of pages?
- how are any user interaction animations or transitions generated?

#### Assessment 1 Marking criteria

##### An understanding of front-end web code (60% of assignment mark):

- A clear understanding of how HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript as used in the chosen websites.
- An understanding of any third-party code or frameworks.
- Knowledge of some current and industry-standard practice within front-end web development, with historical context.

##### A well-structured essay (25% of assignment mark)

- Clear use of semantically structured headings, comparison tables, lists etc. in your essay.
- Annotated and/or titled illustrations (screen shots, diagrams, etc.) to explain your points.

##### Use of references (15% of assignment mark)

- Include references to information sources to back up your observations (see the [DMU Library guide on Harvard Referencing](http://www.library.dmu.ac.uk/Support/Guides/index.php?page=495).

For Turnitin, please use RTF, Word documents or PDFs ([see “What type of files can be submitted in Turnitin?“](http://www.library.dmu.ac.uk/Support/Justask/index.php?page=175&faqcategory=14#f6)). To gain experience in other more future-friendly formats you could also generate a PDF of your essay from Markdown, Multimarkdown or LaTeX (if you do this, add a note to explain your choice). In all cases, make sure your external links and links to references all resolve correctly.

### Assessment 2: practical project
65% of overall marks  
Deadline: 12pm Wednesday 13/12/2017 (week 11) (TBC)   
Submitted: printed GitHub URL to FOTAC

#### Deliverable:
1. the final **project code**
2. a **README.md** file with:  
3. any rough plans and sketches: text annotations and/or brief notes (400 words + screenshots) about your development process, issues solved, code comments.

Please make sure you double check the GitHub URL before submitting. Also make sure your repository is **public** and your site is accessable via GitHub Pages.

#### Can include:
- initial design ideas, sketches or screenshots (e.g. a greyscale/plain wireframe prototype)
- prototype screenshots (you can use something like [Invision](https://www.invisionapp.com/) for this or code basic rough pages in HTML/CSS/JS)
- a navigation plan, IA diagrams or site diagram

#### Should demonstrate:
- the correct semantic use of HTML5 elements
- CSS styes for layout of HTML5 elements
- working responsive design code
- understanding and use of basic JavaScript interactions
- reference to design theory
- understanding of IA and navigability
- evidence of intelligent research and references (to any snippets of code or libraries, frameworks, online resources and articles, books, etc.)

#### Assessment 2 Marking criteria
- validity, tidiness and standards-compliance of the source code
- correct and well-formed HTML5 code structure
- creative use of CSS3 features
- effective and/or creative use of Javascript
- evidence of user testing and resulting changes
- sound understanding of the written code
- effectiveness of navigation, information architecture, interaction design and accessibility/usability
- coherence of the general design, correct preparation of any visual elements, including images and CSS styles and effects
- quality of content and suitability for proposed audience
- depth of coding skills and creative use of available technologies

## University policy

### Anonymous marking
Because of the practical nature of this module, there will be no anonymous marking, as the origin of each students’ work is obvious to the tutors from workshop sessions.

### Late work
This will be penalised according to university rules and regulations. These rules also apply to work submitted after a *14-day extension deadline* authorised by the Module Tutor/Leader.

Coursework received after 2.00pm on the deadline date
: *without an agreed extension* will be stamped ‘late’ and marked down accordingly. The centre (FOTAC) will close promptly at the published times, so work cannot be accepted until 9.00am on the following working day.

Coursework submitted within 7 days from the deadline
: *without prior permission from the Module Tutor/Leader* will be subject to a cap of **40%**

Coursework submitted later than 7 days after the deadline
: *with no prior notice* will receive a mark of **0%**.

### Extensions
These may be granted for significant reasons (e.g. health issues, serious family problems, etc.) They **cannot** be granted for bad the management, pressure from other module deadlines, minor illness, etc.

### Deferrals, failure and reassessment
In very exceptional circumstances, a deferral may be granted.

If you are judged to have failed the course, contact your workshop tutor as soon as possible for advice on what practical work to undertake in order to resubmit for reassessment, and when studio facilities will be available, if required.

### Plagiarism (using work from other sources)
Before you write anything, read the DMU library page [“What is plagiarism”](http://www.library.dmu.ac.uk/Support/Justask/index.php?page=175&faqcategory=14#f1). As for copying code, developers often examine source code from other sites and adapt features they like into their own work. However, pre–designed templates that entire designs, copying tutorials mindlessly, or taking code wholly or substantially from other sources is not acceptable for assessments, as you will learn very little. So always explain *if and how* you have adapted any third-party code or online tutorials and examples to demonstrate that you understand what you’re doing.

The practical work submitted for this course must be your own, so be aware that tutors know how to check source code in detail. The essay will be submitted via Turnitin, which highlights copied text.

**For further information**, please refer to the [student regulations on the DMU website](http://www.dmu.ac.uk/dmu-students/the-student-gateway/academic-support-office/student-regulations.aspx).
